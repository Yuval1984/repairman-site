# Place Your Electrician Photo Here

## Required Image

Add your electrician photo to this folder:

**Filename**: `electrician.jpg` (or `electrician.png`)
**Location**: `public/assets/electrician.jpg`

## Current Status

‚ùå **Image is missing!** The website is looking for this image but it doesn't exist yet.

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 400-500px width (height will auto-adjust)
- **Content**: Professional photo of electrician with tools/equipment
- **Background**: Yellow background (#f4b000) works best with the design

## Steps to Add:

1. **Get your photo** (from the screenshot you showed me)
2. **Save it as**: `electrician.jpg`
3. **Place it here**: `C:\Repos\repairman-site\public\assets\electrician.jpg`
4. **Refresh your browser** - the image should load

## If using PNG instead:

If your image is PNG format, update the HTML file:

File: `src/app/components/electrician-page/electrician-page.html`

Change line 5 from:

```html
<img src="/assets/electrician.jpg" ...
```

To:

```html
<img src="/assets/electrician.png" ...
```

---

**Current HTML expects**: `/assets/electrician.jpg`

Once you add the file, the image will appear on the electrician page!
